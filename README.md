# Server Side Ethereum Demo using Rails
This app demonstrates who to write server side Ethereum code. Most of the tutorials I 
found focus on Dapps -- I'd recommend [this Dapp tutorial by ConsenSys](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4#.9wq3jadqf) 
if that's what you're looking for. However, I wanted to manipulate an Ethereum node from
a backend server.
